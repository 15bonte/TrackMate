GUI
- Have a manual spot editing tool in the 3D viewer displayer.
- Have a separate configuration panel that allows for instance 
		- specifying if we want to save the spot snapshot in the xml file;
		- if we want to store data as a zipped xml file
- Add panel allowing to specify what spot features we want to compute. Maybe this should
go in the separate configuration panel. This needs rewriting the spot features, so that
we only walk with a list of them, not whith the whole enum values. That could foster the
de-enumification noted below. 


Design:
- De-enumify TrackMate to implement Johannes idea.


Bugs:
- Fix SpotEditTool not recognizing a second instance of TrackMate.
- Check if a split event can be detected at first frame (and converse
for merge events at last frame).
- Check if there is conflict between gap closing and track splitting, 
using the TrackMateEgo image file (look at the C).
- Check if TrackScheme still reports edge deletion problems.
- When in the panel that allow selecting tracker, saving saves nothing.
- The name of the tracker displayed in the tracker config panel turns not 
to be the right one after moving back and forth in the GUI (again).
- DEADLY: using feature threshold in linking seems to have NO EFFECT.


Features:
- Implement edge features. Maybe not.


Segmenting:
- Implement the C.elegans algo from Santella et al 2010.
- Implement an algorithm to segment cell imaged in phase-contrast.


Tracking:
- Offer to completely skip the 2nd step in LAP resolution, and only perform
the frame to frame linking. 


Actions:
- Set radius to estimate should refresh the displayer.


Track scheme
- Add the ability to name tracks.
- Add a side table to display track features.
- Allow to export side tables content to csv or xls.
- Selection and graph modification should be done on a separate thread, because for
large graphs, they are quite slow and block everything.


Export/Import
- Offer to select displayer at load.
- Save the spot images in the xml file.
- Make a MATLAB function to import xml files as MATLAB variables. In progress.


Making it available.
- Write wiki doc.
- Publish an application note.
