GUI
- Have a manual spot editing tool in the 3D viewer displayer.
- Display spot names in the 3D displayer.

Design:
- De-enumify TrackMate to implement Johannes idea.

Bugs:
- Fix SpotEditTool not recognizing a second instance of TrackMate.
- Check if a split event can be detected at first frame (and converse
for merge events at last frame).

Features:
- Multi-thread the computation of features.
- Implement edge features.

Segmenting
- Multi-thread calls to segmenter, one thread per time point
(migh be akward, since a single call to a segmenter *might* be 
multithreaded as well).
- Implement the C.elegans algo from Santella et al 2010.
- Implement an algorithm to segment cell imaged in phase-contrast.

Track scheme
- Add the ability to name tracks.
- Add a side table to display track features.
- Allow to export side tables content to csv or xls.

Export/Import
- Offer to select displayer at load.
- Save the spot images in the xml file.
- Make a MATLAB function to import xml files as MATLAB variables.

Making it available.
- Write wiki doc.
- Publish an application note.
